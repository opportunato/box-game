# Embed Starter Kit


Use this repo as a boilerplate for future embeds

1. `npm install` and then `npm start`, open http://localhost:3000.
2. `npm run build` will build project for production.

## IDE

We write our code in Sublime Text, so if you intent to contribute you should do it in that editor.

1. Install [EditorConfig plugin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime)
2. Setup [linting plugin](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/lint-like-it-s-2015-6987d44c5b48).

- You may notice that if you try to commit and you messed up in the source code, linting prevent your commit. So keep it clean and donâ€™t turn off linting, because history will show who did dirty stuff.
```
